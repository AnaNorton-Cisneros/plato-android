# Plato Android

### Are you ready to learn how to develop Android apps?
This project will walk you through a guided, interactive tutorial on all the main
things you need to know to be ready to try your hand at building your own Android app!

### How do I get started?
To get started, you'll want to fork this repo and clone the forked repo to the computer you
will be working through this tutorial on. If your new to git, see the Github documentation on
forking and cloning repos.

Forking: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
Cloning: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

The tutorial is driven by the application itself, so you'll need to open Android Studio, open or
create an emulator, and build this project. Once the app is built, just follow the prompts!
